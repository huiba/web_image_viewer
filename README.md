# Simple Flask based Web Image Browser

## Introduction
This Flask application provides a web interface for browsing through images stored in a specific directory on the server. It also features an option to apply histogram equalization to any image, enhancing its contrast for better visibility. This functionality is particularly useful for viewing images in environments where lighting conditions may not be ideal, or for images that are naturally low in contrast.

## Features
- **Image Browsing:** Navigate through directories and view images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif) stored on the server.
- **Histogram Equalization:** Dynamically apply histogram equalization to images to improve their contrast directly from the web interface.
- **Safe Navigation:** Access files and directories safely without exposing the server to security risks.
- **Session Management:** User session management to remember preferences like histogram equalization toggle across browsing sessions.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Pillow

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or server.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Pillow
    ```
3. Set the `BASE_DIR` variable in the script to point to the directory you want to browse.

### Running the Application
Execute the following command from the directory containing the application:
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will start running on `http://0.0.0.0:5001/`. You can access it from your web browser.

## Usage
- Navigate to `http://<server-ip>:5001/browse/` to start browsing through the images stored under the `BASE_DIR`.
- Click on any image to view it. If histogram equalization is enabled, the image will be displayed with the applied effect.
- Toggle the histogram equalization feature by sending a POST request to `/toggle_histogram_eq` with JSON data `{"enable": true}` or `{"enable": false}`.

## Customization
- **Change Port:** Modify the `port` parameter in `app.run()` to use a different port.
- **Secret Key:** Change the `app.secret_key` to something unique and secure for session management.
